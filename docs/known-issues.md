* The flow for manually adding Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions
  sucks
* Fullscreen windows aren't supported (and probably won't be) and break the
  state (probably shouldn't)
* Application hiding isn't supported (and probably won't be) and breaks the
  state (probably shouldn't)
* Resizing windows by dragging with animations on is a train wreck; don't do it
