## Overview

_komorebi for Mac_ is a tiling window manager that works as an extension to the
standard macOS desktop environment.

_komorebi for Mac_ aims to make _as few modifications as possible_ to the
operating system and desktop environment by default.

_komorebi for Mac_ is currently under development, and this repository is
currently restricted to sponsors.

## Community

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx) available for
_komorebi_-related discussion, help, troubleshooting etc. If you have any
specific feature requests or bugs to report, please create an issue in this
repository.

There is
a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg)
where I post _komorebi_ development videos, feature previews and release
overviews. Subscribing to the channel (which is monetized as part of the YouTube
Partner Program) and watching videos is a really simple and passive way to
contribute financially to the development and maintenance of _komorebi_.

There is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/awesome-komorebi) which
showcases the many awesome projects that exist in the _komorebi_ ecosystem.

On a high level this means that you are free to do whatever you want with

Anyone is free to make their own fork of `komorebi` with changes intended either

## Sponsorship for Personal Use

_komorebi for Mac_ is a free and educational source project, and one that
encourages you to make charitable donations if you find the software to be
useful and have the financial means.

I encourage you to make a charitable donation to
the [Palestine Children's Relief Fund](https://pcrf1.app.neoncrm.com/forms/gaza-recovery)
or to contribute to a [Gaza Funds campaign](https://gazafunds.com) before you
consider sponsoring me on GitHub.

Sponsors can claim custom roles on the Discord server, get shout outs at the end
of _komorebi_-related videos on YouTube, gain the ability to submit feature
requests on the issue tracker, and receive releases of komorebi with "easter
eggs" on physical media.

If you would like to tip or sponsor the project but are unable to use GitHub

subscription only. All provisions and restrictions enumerated in
the [Komorebi License](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license) will continue
